        <p>The Doge meme is one of the internet's most beloved and enduring phenomena. It features a Shiba Inu dog named Kabosu, who became famous for her expressive, sideways glance and crossed paws. Kabosu was adopted in 2008 by Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Sato, who began sharing photos of her pets on her blog. In 2010, one particular image of Kabosu was posted online, and the internet quickly transformed it into a meme by adding humorous, broken English captions in Comic Sans font, such as “such wow” and “so noble.”</p>
        <p>The meme gained immense popularity, spreading across platforms like Reddit and Tumblr. In December 2013, the Dogecoin cryptocurrency was launched, using Kabosu's image as its logo. Initially created as a joke, Dogecoin gained significant attention, especially with endorsements from figures like Elon Musk.</p>
        <p>Kabosu's influence extended beyond memes and cryptocurrency. In 2021, a digital artwork of her image was sold as a non-fungible token (NFT) for $4 million. She also became a symbol of internet culture, inspiring merchandise, art, and even a documentary titled underDOGE. Kabosu passed away on May 24, 2024, at the estimated age of 18, leaving behind a legacy as the face of one of the most iconic memes in internet history.</p>
        <p>Despite her fame, Kabosu led a peaceful life, enjoying naps with her feline companions. Her story is a testament to the unexpected ways in which the internet can elevate a beloved pet to global stardom.</p>
